<h2>PROJECT: MyICS Version 1.0</h2></br>
<h3>SUB-PROJECT: "TempGauge-MyICSv1"</h3></br>

<h3>Background:</h3>              
TempGauge-MyICSv1 is a sub project of the MyICS Version 1.0 project, a four-part venture to design and construct 
a mock industrial environment for the purposes of conducting operational technology (OT) network reconnaissance
and penetration testing.  

<h3>Purpose:</h3></br>
<p>TempGauge-MyICSv1 is a single piece of software the provides a momentary glance at the status of a single
temperature reading via an LCD or other display surface, provided through a graphical user interface (GUI).  
Version 1 features readings based on the following (and will be tailored in the future for specific protocols):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Signal reading type (temperature, pressure, etc...)</li>
        <li>IP address (again, this is based on specific protocols which will be a variable in future versions)</li>
        <li>Subnet mask</li>
        <li>Connection type (protocol type)</li>
        <li>PORT </li>
        <li>BAUD rate (if applicable with certain connections).  </li>
    </ol>
