PROJECT: MyICS Version 1.0
SUB-PROJECT: "TempGauge-MyICSv1"

Background:              
TempGauge-MyICSv1 is a sub project of the MyICS Version 1.0 project, a four-part venture to design and construct 
a mock industrial environment for the purposes of conducting operational technology (OT) network reconnaissance
and penetration testing.  

Purpose:
TempGauge-MyICSv1 is a single piece of software the provides a momentary glance at the status of a single
temperature reading via an LCD or other display surface, provided through a graphical user interface (GUI).  
Version 1 features readings based on the following (and will be tailored in the future for specific protocols):
    1)  Reading type (temperature, pressure, etc...)
    2)  IP address (again, this is based on specific protocols which will be a variable in future versions)
    3)  Subnet mask
    4)  Connection type (protocol type)
    5)  PORT 
    6)  BAUD rate (if applicable with certain connections).
